        Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and erupts
        up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, as she plays
        15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. According to Maori
        culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods To the left of Pohutu
        (when viewing from the bridge) is the “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser
        – named after Prince Edward Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was
        traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins
        before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to
        seven metres (almost 23 feet). The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days
        from the blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet
        can reach heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named
        after the New Zealand Pigeon. Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker
        on earth, shooting boiling water and steam into the air. All geysers
        have three components; an intensive heat source, a constant supply of
        water and an underground plumbing system. As rainfall fills the
        intricate plumbing system below the earth’s surface, molten rock rapidly
        heats the water. The water is under significant pressure causing the
        boiling point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius. As pockets of water
        become turbulent, the pressure is relieved by violently shooting steam
        and water into the air with tremendous force.

      <p class="kiwi_text">
        Te Puia’s Kiwi Conservation Centre provides an unparalleled experience
        with our national treasures. Witness live, active Kiwis in their
        nocturnal enclosure, observe their foraging behaviours, explore their
        history, and discover our conservation initiatives. Our purpose-built
        environment features specialized lighting for vegetation growth, an
        isolation room for sick or injured Kiwis, soundproof panels, and is part
        of the national captive management program for North Island Brown Kiwi,
        under the coordination of the Zoo Aquarium Association (ZAA). No
        Photography, Videography or Mobile Phones: To ensure the well-being of
        our Kiwi, photography and filming are not allowed in the Kiwi enclosure.
        Please silence your mobile phones as screen lights can affect the Kiwi.

    <h2>Geothermal Mud Pools</h2>
    <div class="mudpool">
      <img
        class="mudpool_img"

        alt="Mud Pools"
      />
      <p class="mudpool_text">
        The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause the
        decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called kaolin.
        Kaolin is white when pure, but finely divided black sulphur turns it to
        grey. The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the
        temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 90-95 degrees
        Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit). This mud pool is also known as the
        “Frog Pool” because of the similarity between the plopping mud and
        leaping frogs. Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that are
        used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. Māori
        traditionally used the mud to treat stomach infections by mixing a small
        amount with water and drinking it. Mud pools are created in areas that
        have limited hot water, but abundant supplies of steam and rock. That
        “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen sulphide released
        by geothermal features. When released into the air, the hydrogen
        sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This acid has the
        ability to dissolve rock into fine particles of silica and clay, and
        when combined with a small supply of water, a mud pool is created. The
        Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other beauty products is
        sourced from mud pools about ten times the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud
        Pool.
