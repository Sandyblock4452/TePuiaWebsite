        The New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute has produced many world
        renowned taonga over the years. These commissioned pieces were NZMACI
        designed, carved, and crafted by our masters using authentic Māori
        techniques, which align with the kaupapa of the commissioned piece.

        Encounter the Southern Hemisphere’s largest natural geyser, Pōhutu
        Geyser, which naturally erupts skyward over 15 times during a day. This
        is New Zealand’s most prolific geyser and is a sight to behold. Watch
        skilled carvers and weavers demonstrate their expertise at the New
        Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute, where indigenous material
        culture is on display through the lens of internationally recognized
        artists. During the day, embark on the Te Rā Guided Experience, led by
        passionate guides who infuse a personal touch into Te Puia’s history and
        lineage. Explore a Jurassic-like landscape featuring native bush,
        geysers, and mud pools. Add a spine-tingling cultural performance to
        your tour for the Te Rā + Haka combo. This includes the traditional
        welcome ceremony, songs, chants, poi, and haka within the impressive
        traditionally carved wharenui or meeting house. When the sun goes down,
        Te Puia takes on a whole new life and feel. Our evening hosts then usher
        you to the exquisitely carved meeting house, Te Aronui a Rua, for a
        night of cultural entertainment before boarding the electric shuttle to
        finish the evening with a hot chocolate beneath the stars, surrounded by
        geothermal steam and sound.
