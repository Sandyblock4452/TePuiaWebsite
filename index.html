            world renowned taonga over the years. These commissioned pieces were
             NZMACI designed, carved, and crafted by our masters using authentic
              Māori techniques, which align with the kaupapa of the commissioned

            Encounter the Southern Hemisphere’s largest natural geyser, Pōhutu 
            Geyser, which naturally erupts skyward over 15 times during a day. 
            This is New Zealand’s most prolific geyser and is a sight to behold.
Watch skilled carvers and weavers demonstrate their expertise at the New Zealand
 Māori Arts and Crafts Institute, where indigenous material culture is on 
 display through the lens of internationally recognized artists.
During the day, embark on the Te Rā Guided Experience, led by passionate guides 
who infuse a personal touch into Te Puia’s history and lineage. Explore a 
Jurassic-like landscape featuring native bush, geysers, and mud pools.
Add a spine-tingling cultural performance to your tour for the Te Rā + Haka 
combo. This includes the traditional welcome ceremony, songs, chants, poi, 
and haka within the impressive traditionally carved wharenui or meeting house.
When the sun goes down, Te Puia takes on a whole new life and feel. Enjoy a 
Hāngī Buffet Dinner + Haka with our evening Te Pō from 5:30pm or upgrade to 
our Te Pō Combo (Guided Experience, Buffet Dinner + Haka) which starts every 
day at 4pm with an afternoon guided experience and then guests are invited to 
join Te Pō diners in Pātaka Kai Bar, Restaurant & Café for a sumptuous hāngī 
dinner buffet. Our evening hosts then usher you to the exquisitely carved 
meeting house, Te Aronui a Rua, for a night of cultural entertainment before 
boarding the electric shuttle to finish the evening with a hot chocolate beneath
 the stars, surrounded by geothermal steam and sound.
As the sun sets and the world hushes into darkness, the most captivating love 
story in Rotorua’s geothermal wonderland awakens, and you’re invited to be part 
of it. Geyser By Night is a magical journey that until now, was a closely 
guarded secret. Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley reveals its secrets under the
 velvet embrace of night, promising a sensory spectacle that exists nowhere else
  on Earth. This evening walking tour explores parts of the geothermal valley 
  that are not seen during the day.
